This project solves a vehicle routing problem (VRP) for garbage trucks.
The project was actualized with 2k nodes and 10 trukcs approximately.
Flask library was used to build a web framework to upload data files which consist of coordinate points of nodes and truck data file.
Parallel programming was used to solve the problem.
Each truck has a region which is determined by K-Means to collect the garbage containers.

The project outputs the path as KML file.
